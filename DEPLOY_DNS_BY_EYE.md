# Deploy Functional DNS By Eye - Immediate Fix

## 🚨 Current Issue

DNS By Eye is currently showing an informational page instead of the actual tool. To make DNS By Eye functional, we need to deploy the microservices architecture.

## 🚀 Fix DNS By Eye Now

Run these commands on your server to make DNS By Eye functional with SSL:

```bash
# Pull latest code (includes SSL microservices deployment)
sudo git pull origin main

# Stop current deployment
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-tools.yaml down 2>/dev/null || sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.ssl.yaml down

# Deploy SSL-enabled microservices architecture with functional DNS By Eye
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-tools-ssl.yaml up -d --build

# Check status (all containers should be running)
sudo docker ps
```

**Note**: The latest update includes:
- ✅ **SSL Support**: Full HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates
- ✅ **Microservices Architecture**: Separate DNS By Eye and Tools Portal services
- ✅ **Nginx Configuration**: Fixed rate limiting and service routing
- ✅ **Production Ready**: All security headers and optimizations

## ✅ What This Provides

After running the commands above:

- **Tools Portal**: https://tools.apathy.ca/ (Landing page)
- **Functional DNS By Eye**: https://tools.apathy.ca/dns-by-eye/ (Full working tool)
- **All DNS By Eye features**: API endpoints, graph generation, health scoring
- **Enhanced features**: Smart graph condensation, improved health scoring

## 🔧 Architecture

The microservices deployment provides:

- **Main Portal Service**: Landing page and tool discovery
- **DNS By Eye Service**: Complete DNS analysis tool running independently
- **Nginx Routing**: Routes `/dns-by-eye/` to the DNS By Eye service
- **Shared Redis**: Caching across all services
- **Automated Cleanup**: Manages generated graph files

## 📊 DNS By Eye Features (Working)

- ✅ **DNS delegation tracing**: Full chain analysis
- ✅ **Visual graph generation**: PNG diagrams for each level
- ✅ **Smart graph condensation**: Shows first 3 nameservers + "X more" for large sets
- ✅ **Enhanced health scoring**: Layered approach with realistic penalties
- ✅ **Glue record analysis**: Comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Cross-reference graphs**: Nameserver relationship visualization
- ✅ **API endpoints**: All original functionality preserved
- ✅ **Export capabilities**: JSON and CSV formats

## 🎯 This Fixes

- ❌ "Tool Integration in Progress" message → ✅ Fully functional DNS By Eye
- ❌ Informational page only → ✅ Complete DNS analysis tool
- ❌ No DNS functionality → ✅ All original features + enhancements

## 🔄 Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback to the simple Tools Portal:

```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-tools.yaml down
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.ssl.yaml up -d --build
```

## 🎉 Result

After deployment, DNS By Eye will be fully functional at https://tools.apathy.ca/dns-by-eye/ with all enhanced features working.
